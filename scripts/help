#About Errors & Logs
#-------------------
	# Errors and Infos (echo) logged by the installation/upgrade/uninstallation scripts can be found via: cat /var/log/packages/<Package Name>.log
	# Additional info can also be found via: sudo cat /var/log/synopkg.log
	# Errors and Infos (echo) logged by wizards' scripts are not in any of those log files.
	#	For this reason, MODS logs Wizard's scripts info into /tmp/$SYNOPKG_PKGNAME.log and recopy that file into standard log asap

	# Check if MODS' stuff remains after uninstallation or is well installed
	#ls /usr/syno/etc/packages/MODS_Sample_Simple_CGI_7.x/ /usr/syno/share/nginx/conf.d/dsm.MODS*
	#ls /usr/syno/share/nginx/conf.d/dsm.MODS*

	# Check MODS' outputs and remove then for next installation attempts
	#sudo cat /tmp/MODS* /var/log/synopkg.log  /var/log/packages/MODS_Sample_Simple_CGI_7.x.log
	#sudo rm -f /var/log/packages/MODS_Sample_Simple_CGI_7.x.log /var/log/synopkg.log /tmp/MODS*
	# Or in one line (without synopkg.log)
	#sudo cat /tmp/MODS* /var/log/packages/MODS_Sample_Simple_CGI_7.x.log; sudo rm -f /var/log/packages/MODS_Sample_Simple_CGI_7.x.log /tmp/MODS*
